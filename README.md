Password complexity checker
The purpose of a password complexity checker is to evaluate the strength of a given password based on several criteria. Strong passwords are harder for attackers to guess or crack using techniques like brute force or dictionary attacks. The script evaluates the password against the following criteria:
Length: A minimum length of 8 characters ensures the password has sufficient complexity.
Uppercase Letters: At least one uppercase letter increases the variability of the password.
Lowercase Letters: At least one lowercase letter adds diversity to the password.
Numbers: Including numbers increases the entropy of the password.
Special Characters: Characters like !@#$%^&* make the password less predictable.
